The tool consists of the following modules:
* Data retrieval: responsible for collecting data from social networking platforms.
* Data preprocessing: methods that clean data of irrelevant information and prepares them for the application of the sentiment analysis method.
* Sentiment Analysis: applies a model to the data in order to classify them according to their sentiment.
* Data Reprocessing: prepares the data for the visualization process.
* Topic Modeling: applies specific algorithms that identify topics in text corpora. Visualization: represents data in a graph, taking into account the results of all previous processes.
